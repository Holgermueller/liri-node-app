# liri-node-app
Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface; a command line node app.

## What Liri does

Liri acts a bit like Siri, except for two things:

1. Liri can only take command line directions. Liri cannot be spoken to. Well, it can be, just don't expect too much of a response.

2. Liri can only return information from Twitter, Spotify, and OMdb.

So, beyond those two limitations, Liri behaves in a way similar to Siri.

## What you'll need to create your own

Beyond a knowledge of javaScript, Liri requires the following types of file:

* .env

* .gitignore

* package.json

In addition, you'll also need API keys from Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB, which you can easily acquire if you have your own accounts with these websites.

You'll also need the following node modules, for which I'll provide links:

* Twitter: https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter

* Spotify: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api

* Request: https://www.npmjs.com/package/request

* DotEnv: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv

* OMDB: https://www.npmjs.com/package/omdb

* Require: https://www.npmjs.com/package/require

For the most part, the docs accompanying these node modules are pretty informative on how to get started with them. The Twitter one is great. However, the Spotify docs leave a bit to be desired.
